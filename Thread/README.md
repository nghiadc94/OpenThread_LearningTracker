# Thread Network Education
## What is Thread and why using it?
- Thread is a wireless mesh networking technology developed by the Thread Group
- Thread using IEEE 802.15.4 radio (at 2.4 GHz) for operation, same as Zigbee and Z-wave.
- Focus on IoT with low-power mesh networking and self-healing capabilities.
- Support for 6LoWPAN, IPv6, and mesh routing.
## Thread device types and roles
### Device Types
#### Full Thread Device (FTD)
- Radio is constantly enabled
- Always participates in thread network
- Usually are mains powered devices
#### Minimal Thread Device (MTD)
- Not always participates in thread network
- Low power is enabled, such as sleep mode or disable radio
- Usually battery operated devices
